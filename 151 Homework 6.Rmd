## Question 1 (10 pts)

For the dataset `flu`, make a map to show the distribution of the peak number of flu cases at each state in one year of your choice.


```{r}
flu <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/qtm151/main/datasets/flu.csv')
head(flu)
flu2009 <- flu %>% filter(year.Date. == "2009")

states <- map_data("state")
states1 <- states %>% group_by(region)

flustates <- full_join(flu2009, states1)
head(flustates)
ggplot(data = flustates) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = peak, group = group), color = "black") + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="green", high="red")
```
